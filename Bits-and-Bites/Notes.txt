----> Models
Some changes I made to the models.  "Ingredients" table was renamed to "Ingredient".  "UnageData" property in the "RecipieImg" database was renamed to "UsageData" and made a double.  "RecipieImg" was renamed to "Image".  Also I removed the FK "RecipieID" from the image model, we should probably have this in the recipie table to allow us to have one database to store all images, not just ones associated with recipies.  "Recipies" table was renamed to "Recipie".  Changed type of property "CookTime" from DateTime to string.  DateTime types in SQL are kind of a pain with formatting, so I made the date a string and we can just format in as a date using .ToString("MM/dd/yy").  I changed the type of the "CookTime" property from a number to a string since it would have a C or F after it.  I don't know about this one, we might need some complex validation either way here.
